List of things to do in the future

	- RSS feed for genos, so that people can subscribe and be told when the
	  galactic is recently reset.  Jerub expressed an interest in doing it.

	- If you are observing a friendly player who is t-warping, you
	  can lock on to other players/planets, but will not swap to
	  their viewpoint.  Only when twarping is over, you can swap
	  again [Shadow.Hunter@netrek.org]

	- You can always lock onto an independent ship (Iggy)
	  (->planets too?) but after doing that you cannot revert to
	  observing your own team anymore. Bummer ;-(
	  [Shadow.Hunter@netrek.org]

	- tools/update.c sa_sigaction not present on NetBSD.  [Hietbrink]

	- 'transwarp 0 off' to prevent slot 0 from transwarping.  [Swasey]

	- add lag statistics to LTD stats.  [Zach]

	- tail waggle effect, necessary?
	  [work done to fix, by quozl ... in test on continuum]

	- transwarp to base at one update per second ... calculation
	  of navigational lock is made at update rate not internal rate.
	  note: Tom Holub would prefer that this fix not affect the
	  known feature of maxwarp-with-no-fuel = cruising speed + .5
	  - etemp.

	- docs/tools.doc and tools/README say that trimscores argument
          is a niceness value, but it is actually a harshness value.
	  usage() in trimscores.c also doesn't match.

	- end_tourney.pl, replace the final score indicator with more
          meaningful information.  For example, the final planet count
          and final continuous score as printed at the end of the INL log.

	- minor playing a man down fix, if t-mode and no steering or
	  speed changes for ten minutes, free slot.

	- vary observer update rate down when not in use, use lock on
	  player or planet event to increase back.

	- method for starbase to disable transwarp but leave docking
	  enabled.  Dave Ahn to implement.

	- configure checks for gmp more than once, it should check only
	  once.  Perhaps it is configure for res-rsa duplicating effort?

	- make in keycomp/ (and others) use object modules from ntserv,
	  and so a parallel make fails on a multi-processor box.

	- implement automake

	- implement proper configure --prefix usage, so that we install
	  in %{prefix}/games/netrek not in %{prefix}

	- implement configure's other path options, so that read-write
	  data will be in %{prefix}/var/somewhere

	- web page interface to INL server, including privileged
	  functions such as starting, stopping, or restarting the
	  server, and non-privileged functions such as (a)
	  preconfiguring defaults for the next INL game, including
 	  team names and game time, (b) list of recent games, latest
	  first, with team names and final scores, (c) delivery of
	  cambot recording within web browser, (d) feedback to server
	  god.  [Cameron]

	- send player IPs to metaserver for statistics generation [Uram]

	- include server in spiffy download package [Nowakowski]

	- update t-mode messages, they are outdated.

	- there is no way to tell the difference between a busted client and
	  the player simply walking off.

	- need generic shared memory dump tool to assist diagnosis.

	- revisit syntax of .metaservers file to aid understanding,

	- compile with -Wall and fix the problems.
	  [done ntserv, quozl@us.netrek.org]
	  [big set of prototypes missing in tools/cambot.c, quozl]

	- observers, allow them to have a ship of their own that is ineffective
	  and invisible to others.

	- special compile mode for lesser lights trying to build an INL server
	  that avoids trying to compile xsg or pledit, and perhaps a few other
	  things, suggested by Tom Holub [VANILLA-LIST:2566]

	- add command to allow players to change their password.
	  "password newpassword", followed by "confirm newpassword".
	  [partially done]

	- pledit should be able to edit entries in place online.

	- god's text client, displays messages to god and all, and allows
	  entry of replies from god, showgalaxy with more messages visible.

	- From Dave Swasey: Writes to ERRORS should be timestamped.  At least
	  timestamp daemon startup and death (exitDaemon, etc) messages.
	  Timestamps would have helped me determine which messages in ERRORS
	  matter.

	- mark's changes, if p_y or p_x = 100000, ship oscillates
	  [mark hasn't come back to me on that, it awaits him]

	- add IP addresses, port numbers, and byte counters to
	  struct.h for player so we can dump them in tools/players.c;
	  and also to enhance "whois".

	- accumulate byte counters server wide for bandwidth accounting.

	- all the code in the robots/ directory really need some
	  serious cleanup.  the whole thing is a mess.

	- netrekd is now restartable without affecting play, but it would be
	  suitably cool if daemon could also be restarted.  Could also do with
	  a check for change to the shared memory size.

	- connections made immediately after a genocide/conquer seem to stall
	  for up to a minute, happens on continuum and has been confirmed by
	  numerous players,

	- proposed client metaserver window solicitation UDP protocol, to fill
	  out a column of ping times to the server from the client,
	
	- slots that timeout during login or outfit (resurrect) should be moved
	  back onto the wait queue (at end or start?) and their slot given to
	  the current head of queue player.  May require client changes.
	  [ref findslot() in cow, c/- carlos - quozl]

	- observers do not see tractors and pressors ... fault of protocol,
	  according to Trent Piepho (xyzzy@u.washington.edu)

        - Observer system is screwed up.  Needs major re-write.  Items
          of note:

		Observer state is not consistent. Observer state is
                held in p_status, which is overloaded with death,
                life, free, robot states. Every once in a while,
		p_status gets assigned something other than POBSERV.

		stats collection drop-outs for observers, free slots
                and robots not consistent. Stats for observers and
                robots and free slots should not be collected, but for
                some cases they are.

                save() is still called for observers. it shouldn't

                multiple observer state variables. ntserv keeps a
                global Observer.  p_status in shmem is the other.

          Propose removing POBSERV from p_status and Observer ntserv
          global variable ad add p_type to player struct.  Avoids
          overloading a variable.  Example states could be PTPLAYER,
          PTOBSERVER, PTROBOT and PTPRACTICE.  Whenever a slot changes
          modes, save the slot (if appropriate) and re-read stats from
          .players anew as if a fresh login occured but without the
          slot assignment (which would require a client upgrade).

          Cleaning up the observer code is a prerequisite for
          obs<->player switching and non-contiguous INL slot PROJECT
          entries.  First crack at it assigned to Carlos V.

INL robot issues following testing with Tom Holub

	- port 2592 "sorry you can't play now" message needs to be nicer [low]
	  [perhaps make them appear to be on an infinite queue and give them
	  a motd that explains the situation]

	- make GAMETIME response two lines if team name too long [low]

	- observer can change teams?

	- force known team name for REGISTER

	- INL robot entry voted in from pickup, do not do odds/evens swapping,
	  keep old teams if possible, the league does not need 0-7
	  pre-allocation of slots to teams,


INL robot problems reported by d4sand,

	- no RESERVE command present,

	- robot did not see genocide, (fix daemon to not reset galaxy
	  on a genocide or conquer),  (possible fix, Villalpando 1999-jun)

	- could not rejoin after genocide/conquer, (fix daemon to use
	  non-final why-dead flag),  (possible fix, Villalpando 1999-jun)


INL observations by quozl@us.netrek.org

	- need a captain command to bring an obs in as a player, and
	  vice versa

	- sending PAUSE then CONTINUE as a captain causes a
	  superfluous countdown which does nothing.
