source code

robots/inlcmds.c initiates a draft
tools/setgame.c also may initiate a draft
ntserv/draft.c handles the daemon animation of a draft, and actions.

design

- captains both must choose to draft,
- INL robot calls inl_draft_begin(),
- daemon takes over ships,
- captains lock on players desired in their team.
