Addition of RSS feed for Netrek Server.

Events logged by a class type, such as:

- daemon, starts and stops of the universe simulator,
- conquer, wins and losses by team,

Design

- daemon calls blog_* from blog.c,
- blog_* forks and execs tools/blog,
- tools/blog updates filesystem and static content,
- web browser accesses static content.

Software dependencies:

- blosxom, a perl script to generate static HTML from text files

Notes from PROJECTS yet to be implemented

	- RSS feed for genos, so that people can subscribe and be told
	  when the galactic is recently reset.  Jerub expressed an
	  interest in doing it.

	  Content area on netrek.org showing recent contested genos,
	  length of game leading up to it, number of players seen,
	  players per hour, keep latest ten, feed from multiple
	  servers.  Server generated screen shot of final frame.

	  Separate feed for adminstrivia, with server CLI script for
	  adding to the feed.

	  INL server specific feed, containing game results, summary,
	  ltd stats by player.

	  Metaserver specific feed ... new servers listed, delistings,
	  weekly summary of query counts with history.

	  netrekd forked HTTP responder, or scripts to send stuff to a
	  web server?
