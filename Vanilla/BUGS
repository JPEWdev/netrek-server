List of things that are defects

	- god observer should see all teams messages.

	- practice robots fail to shoot torpedoes if created while server 
          is in topgun mode.

	- make clean in ntserv doesn't.

	- configure's "checking for BSD style signals" doesn't finish
	  with a yes or a no.

	- quitting as captain in INL game should automatically uncaptain.

	- team masks are switched at the end of an INL game.  is
	  there any particular reason why we're doing this?

	- manually check dependencies in ntserv, an installer found
	  that a defs.h change was not picked up by at least one thing
	  therein, and so a make clean was required.

	- if installer changes config.h.in and then config.h manually,
	  running make causes configure to be re-run but without the
	  appropriate --prefix, thus building for the wrong place.

	- inl confine doesn't knock ships out of orbit, ships may
	  remain outside their confined zone.

	- configure script, add recognition of --with-inl, and thus
	  define all the appropriate defines that INSTALL.INL says we
	  have to do, change PKEY too.

	- configure to set CONFIRM=1 if it finds res-rsa, and Makefile
	  to recommend the execution of updated at least once.

	- xsg Makefile (and others perhaps) compile
	  "../ntserv/getpath.c" saving the object file into the xsg
	  directory, and then promptly use the object files from the
	  ntserv directory, regardless of whether they are built yet.
	  Need to change it to either use the local copy (and thus waste
	  compile time), or nest into the ntserv Makefile.

	- lock navigation move to daemon from ntserv, problems are evident
	  with transwarp and planetary locks at low update rates.  Do
	  navigation recalculations at daemon update rate (10u/s).

	- switching into or out of no-geno timer hours on continuum resets quit
	  timeout, perhaps due to repeat of RSA verification.

	- jammed slots on other teams?  Can they be ejected?

	- practice robots drop shields as soon as you die, thus taking torps
	  in flight on hull.

	- change metaserver solicitation to process multiple IP addresses from
	  each DNS host name given, just like new COW metaserver code.
	  [coding in progress by cameron@stl.dec.com]
	  
	- starbase etemp bug, still shows up, engine cooling rate reduced,
	  warp 2 gives stable etemp, under those conditions it should drop
	  slowly at warp 2,

	- "make rmdependencies" breaks because res-rsa does not have such a
	  target.  Should it?
