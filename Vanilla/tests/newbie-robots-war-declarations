Test process used by Jimmy Huang for Newbie robots war declarations.

1. start Marvin in a newbie server.

2. time it just right (1 second after t-mode starts) and start another
Marvin in the same server, in a 3rd scumming team. Use port 3592 so he
can join any team.

3. watch the war declarations.

4. watch the fighting to make sure, they do the right thing.

5. make the 3rd space scummer leave after a while (like he would if he
joined the regular port).

6. make the first Marvin's team lose via timercide.  Marvin will be
forced onto a different team.

7. watch war declarations and make sure Marvin does the right thing as
far as war goes.

After Genocide, Marvin will be forced onto yet another team. Make sure
he does the right war declarations again.

Did this 2 times, and seems to work good.
