	* gum.xml: add newbie flag.  [rebuild using glade 0.5.5 by Quozl]

Mon Apr 23 18:30:34 2001  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* .cvsignore: add files to ignore.
	* gum.xpm: missing from CVS, found due to .cvsignore, hurray.
	* Makefile: regenerated using Glade; differences irrelevant.
	* autogen.sh: add, generated by Glade.

Wed Apr 18 14:33:03 2001  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* gum.xml: fix to galactic wrap widget name from Federico Grau
	<donfede@casagrau.org>

Wed Aug  4 21:55:25 1999  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* signals.h: Added the gnomeui stuff to get gum to compile. Not
	sure if this is the right place.

	* Makefile.am: Added libraries to support the invalid group/glade
	code. This over course will change all the auto-gen'd files.	

Fri Jul 30 03:10:01 1999  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* gum.xml:  Used glade tool to create an invalid group permission
	dialog box, which I'll display if the group permission do not
	allow the user to write to the netrek configuration files.

	* id.c: Moved functional prototypes into id.h, included id.h.

Thu Jul 29 00:05:45 1999  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* id.c: Added some functional prototypes to get some of the
	warnings. 

Wed Jul 28 18:52:08 1999  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* Makefile.am (gum_SOURCES): Do not need getugroups.c.

Wed Jul 28 02:24:17 1999  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* getugroups.c: Do not think I need this anymore. Took the
	concepts and incorporated them into id.c, but left in because of
	the GPL of the code I did not know what to do.

	* xmalloc.c: Used code directly from the GNU sh-utils. Left it as
	is. 

	* id.c: BETA :-) release of the functions. Some simple wrappers to
	get all the groups a user belongs AND now search it for membership
	in a particular group.

	* Makefile.in (gum_SOURCES): Added the verify user code to the
	Makefile.

Tue Jul 27 02:19:55 1999  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* id.c (main): Start of the code that will verify that the user is
	part of the "games" group so that they can run gum when it is set
	4110, aka you must be user games, or in the group games to run the
	program. 

Mon Jul 19 00:49:55 1999  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* gum.xml: add splash welcome widget, position centre, no window
	manager border.

	* Makefile.am (gum_LDADD): rebuild file under glade 0.5.0

	* signals.c (main): add one second event pause to allow viewing of
	the splash window, stolen from Crossfire client's gx11.c splash
	code.

	* signals.c (on_About_activate): revise about screen to show who
	to complain to.
